### Troubleshooting

Error: localStorage is not defined

This error typically occurs if the app is trying to use localStorage during server-side rendering or in a non-browser environment (such as during unit testing).

To fix this, ensure that the code accessing localStorage is only run in the browser. You can do this by checking if window or localStorage is available before using it.

if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.localStorage) {
  const data = localStorage.getItem('key');
}
